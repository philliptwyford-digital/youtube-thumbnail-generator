# 🚀 AI YouTube Thumbnail Architect

**A Click-Through Rate (CTR) optimization tool built with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro.**

## 📋 Overview
As a Digital Marketer, I know that the best video content fails if the packaging isn't right. I built this tool to automate the creative strategy behind high-performing YouTube thumbnails.

Instead of guessing, this tool uses AI to generate:
* **Psychological Hooks:** Triggers based on curiosity, urgency, or transformation.
* **Visual Composition:** Detailed scene descriptions using the Rule of Thirds.
* **Color Strategy:** Hex codes selected for psychological impact.
* **Generative Prompts:** Ready-to-copy prompts for Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Imagen.

## ⚙️ How It Works
This repository contains the Python code to interact with the Google Gemini API. However, you can also use the **System Instructions** below directly in Google AI Studio or ChatGPT.

### The System Prompt
If you want to run this manually, paste the following into your AI's "System Instructions":

> **Role:** You are a World-Class YouTube Thumbnail Architect and Click-Through Rate (CTR) Strategist.
> **Objective:** When I provide a Video Title, generate 3 distinct thumbnail concepts.
> **Output Structure:**
> 1. The Hook (Psychological trigger)

> 4. Color Palette (Hex codes + reasoning)
> 5. Image Generation Prompt (Technical prompt for Midjourney/DALL-E)
